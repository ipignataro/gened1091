Hello! Welcome to the GENED1091 Concepts Quiz! This file will explain how you can access the quiz.
You've already downloaded the project folder, so great job completing step 1!
NOTE: All of the following steps are for MacOS

Here are the next steps - 

2. Navigate back to the project folder (it is most likely in your Downloads folder)
3. Right click on the project folder
4. Click the option that says "New Terminal at Folder" (this should be second from bottom)

You should now be in the terminal environment. Almost there!

5. In the terminal environment type "python 1091.py"
6. Follow the prompts and take the quiz

Congrats, you made it! In case you didn't...here are some common errors - 

Problem: You don't see the "New Terminal at Folder" option
Solution: Be sure you right click on the actual folder (the blue thing) and not the script or CSV file within the folder.

Problem: When you type the text in step 5, the program doesn't work.
Solution: Download python onto your computer.
